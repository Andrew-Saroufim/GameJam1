# GameJam1

In this project i have learnt a lot about Unity i learnt how to navigate through the different elements smoothly and efficiently, i learnt the basis and understanding of many elements and how to use them, like rigidbody, circle and box colliders2D, sprite renderer, and how to slice slices to make them into the way i want them to be and also ready to be animated which also lead me to learn how to use animators and animating. Furthermore, i learnt how to code and use the scripts in unity, the sources i used to learn were, information picked up in class, the information uploaded on blackboard, the unity documentation and youtube tutorials/guides. 

On the other hand i did experience many issues and some that i was unable to fix, a big issue i got was that my character's movement got broken and it was just running in place and not being able to jump, turns out the issue was that my character moved slightly into the ground because i tried to animate the death animation with a y movement downwards i deleted the movement animation and it fixed the issue but now i have the issue that my death animation ends with my character laying down in the air with still no fix for that. 

Another issue was that when creating a respawn system i was not able to get my character to have its movements renabled after respawn and i am still having that issue. 

My final issue is that in the end i had multiple scripts with things scattered everywhere that it started becoming too unorgaized that i wasn't able to properly code my speed buff because i could not find my original speed to reference my buff to. 

i came up with the idea of my game through browsing the unity asset store and seeing types of games created on youtube and then came up with my idea of combining my own ideas with ideas seen online, a red hooded girl going through the forest, a platformer.
